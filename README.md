# Bangladesh-GDP-Prediction-using-VECM-and-LSTM-Models
This repository contains a data-driven analysis and forecast of Bangladesh's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) using two powerful time-series modeling techniques: the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.
The Jupyter Notebook is organized into several key scripts. Below is a detailed explanation of each part.
Script 1: VECM Forecasting Model
This script focuses on building and visualizing a 10-year GDP forecast using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). VECM is suitable for multivariate time series that have a long-run cointegrating relationship.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Load Data: The bangladesh-gdp.csv dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
Preprocessing:
The General government final consumption expenditure column is dropped as it is deemed unnecessary.
The date column is converted to a datetime object and set as the DataFrame index.
Missing numerical values are filled using the median of their respective columns.
All features are normalized to a range of using MinMaxScaler to ensure stable model training.
VECM Modeling:
A VECM is initialized with the scaled data. A cointegration rank of 2 (coint_rank=2) is chosen, suggesting two long-term relationships between the variables.
The model is fitted to the entire dataset.
Forecasting:
The model predicts the values for the next 10 years.
The forecasted values are transformed back to their original scale using scaler.inverse_transform.
Post-processing:
A constraint is applied to ensure that the forecasted GDP never falls below the last known GDP value from 2022.
Visualization: The script generates a plot comparing the historical GDP with the 10-year forecasted GDP, providing a clear visual representation of the prediction.
Script 2: VECM Performance Evaluation
This script evaluates the VECM model's predictive accuracy on unseen data.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Train-Test Split: The scaled dataset is split into a training set (first 80%) and a testing set (last 20%).
Model Training: The VECM is trained only on the training data.
Prediction: The trained model is used to make predictions on the time steps corresponding to the test set.
Metric Calculation: The script calculates key performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared) by comparing the model's predictions with the actual values from the test set. The resulting R-squared value of approximately 0.895 indicates a strong fit.
Script 3: LSTM Forecasting Model
This script implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to provide an alternative, deep learning-based GDP forecast.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Data Preparation:
The data is loaded and cleaned as in the VECM script.
To stabilize variance, the GDP column (GDP_BD) is log-transformed.
The log-transformed GDP is then normalized using MinMaxScaler.
Sequence Creation: A function creates a sequential dataset suitable for LSTMs, where a sequence of the last time_steps (e.g., 3 years) is used to predict the next value.
LSTM Model Architecture:
A Sequential Keras model is built with two LSTM layers (50 units each) and a final Dense output layer.
Training: The model is compiled with the 'adam' optimizer and 'mean_squared_error' loss function. It is trained on the training data.
Autoregressive Forecasting:
A loop generates a 10-year forecast. The model predicts one step ahead, and this prediction is then used as input for the next prediction.
Post-processing & Visualization:
Forecasted values are transformed back from the scaled and logged format to their original GDP values.
A constraint (np.maximum.accumulate) is applied to ensure the forecast is monotonically increasing.
A plot is generated showing the historical GDP against the LSTM's 10-year forecast.
Script 4: LSTM Performance Evaluation
This script assesses the performance of the trained LSTM model on the test data.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Prediction on Test Set: The LSTM model predicts GDP values for the test set.
Inverse Transformation: Both the predicted values and the true test values are transformed back from their scaled and logged format.
Metric Calculation: The script calculates performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared). The resulting R-squared of approximately 0.96 and a MAPE of ~6.9% demonstrate very high accuracy, outperforming the VECM on this task.
Script 5: Exploratory Analysis - Johansen Cointegration Test
This is an important preliminary script that provides the statistical justification for using a VECM.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Johansen Test: The script performs the Johansen Cointegration Test on the key economic variables. This test determines if there is a stable, long-term relationship between them.
Trend Visualization: It plots the long-term trends of all time series features on a single graph, helping to visually identify potential cointegrating relationships.
ðŸ“Š Results Summary
Both models provided strong forecasts, but the LSTM model showed superior performance on the test set.
Metric	VECM Model	LSTM Model
R-squared (RÂ²)	0.895	0.961
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)	0.058 (scaled)	16.52 (original scale)
RMSE	0.081 (scaled)	21.83 (original scale)
Conclusion: The LSTM model, with an RÂ² of 0.96, is the more accurate predictor for this specific GDP forecasting task. Its ability to capture complex non-linear patterns in the univariate time series proved more effective than the VECM's multivariate approach in this case.
